**Purpose of this app**
- This app was fundamental in solidifying the programmer's (myself, Logan McNulty) knowledge of querying MySql databases using command line applications, and also querying and managing SQL databases using MySQL Workbench. 

- The app also required the programmer to reserach querying methods, and metods of which to display data in the command line (cli-app)
